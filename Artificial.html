                    <h3>Robots are in many shapes and sizes, some may be small others may be large. But here is a type of robot that we love and many scientists are trying to perfect and that is humanoid robots.</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Humanoid robots are meant to resemble humans and even act like them and move like them too. The way they do this is by a special motor like component called an actuator. This actuator can act as actual joints and function like them too.</li>
                         
                        <li>As long as there is power to power the robot, they do not require any breaks in between jobs. They cannot exactly work like humans  because it would be very complex and far too hard to accomplish.</li>
                         
                        <li>Humanoids use AI to resemble the humanity and emotions of humans and also to properly to navigate around the area.</li>

                    Pros:
                    </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They are fast: Robots are designed to work in a fast paced environment. They are usually very fast and very effective and can easily perform routine work at very high speeds.</li>
                         
                        <li>They can access inaccessible places: Robots are designed to be used by people to do various jobs.</li>
                         
                        <li>They are independent: Robots do not require human intervention to work or operate. They are accurate: Robots are designed to be perfect in their operations. They are enduring: Robots can work on a particular task for a very long time. They are enduring.</li>
                         
                        <li>They do not need breaks: Robots use power and gasoline in some cases to perform their duties. They can operate in harsh conditions effectively and are time saving.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>
                    Cons:
                    </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Robots need power to work: Unlike humans, robots require the presence of power to function.</li>
                         
                        <li>Robots are one of the major causes for unemployment.</li>
                         
                        <li>Robots are unintelligent and cannot think on their own which is one of the reasons why they are dangerous.</li>

    <h3 style="margin-left: 30px;">We use voice assistants to run our daily tasks like answer questions, interact with apps, turn on lights, etc. Using voice assistants makes perfect sense because it’s quicker & more user-friendly than typing.
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Voice assistants react to voice commands and give the user relevant information about his inquiry. Presently, they are already able to process orders of products, answer questions, etc.</li>
         
        <li>The long-term vision for voice assistants is to act as a smart bridge between humans and the vast knowledge and capacities which the internet delivers.</li>
         
        <li>They have a microphone to hear and speakers to communicate back to us. The assistant will decipher the command and then act independently by searching the web for the right answer and reading it back to the user.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Pros & Cons
    <hr style="width: 230px;">
    </h1>
    <h3>
    Pros:
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They have skills. No matter what the device wants to call their add-on abilities and inborn talents, their expandability seems to be unlimited.</li>
         
        <li>Automating your life gives you more free time.</li>
         
        <li>Helping You Destress. Sure, digital voice assistants can be fun, but they can also be therapeutic.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
    Cons:
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Physical Limitations. Living in the Cloud may be pretty great if you’re a software program, but in the real world, people have to deal with physical objects constantly.</li>
         
        <li>Having a Herd. Digital voice assistants are a little bit like sheep. You need more than one to really make anything work.</li>
         
        <li>Signal Strength. Anyone living outside of a 4G or better network area may struggle to keep their digital assistant alive.</li>

            <h3>Holographic Chats lets you see the 3d model of the person in an open space.</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>This device made by PORTAL lets you talk with the life size hologram of another person. The machines can also be equipped with technology with recorded holograms of historical figures or relatives who have passed away.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Prices for the machine start at $60,000 , a cost that Nassbaum expects to drop down over the next three to five years.</li>
                 <br>
                <li>The company also plans a smaller tabletop device with a lower price tag early next year.
                    The companies are promoting museums which could let visitors question a hologram of a historical feature, and to families to record information for future generations.
                    </li>
                 <br>
                <li>This will definitely have a smile on their face being able to talk to people with holographic devices in a real manner.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>
            Pros:
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It is a very cost effective solution to make and to hire.</li>
<li>It has a higher storage capacity compared to other methods.</li>
<li>It delivers enhanced feasibility of objects including depth.</li>
<li>They are complex patterns and hence offer security in wide applications as mentioned above.</li>
<li>It offers creation of multiple images on a single plate including 3D images.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
            Cons:
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It has higher production cost compared to 2D projection.</li>
                <li>It is not easily seen in the presence of fluorescent lighting.</li>
                <li>Use of applying the concept of holographic projection in the design of products is costly.</li>
